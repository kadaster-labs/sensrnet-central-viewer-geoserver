## Geoserver
Downloaded on 7 1 2021 from http://geoserver.org/release/stable/ as "War Archive". This file is a zip.
Unpacking the zip reveals a .war file. As the .war file is over 100MiB, github will not accept it due to file size. 

To circumvent this issue, unpack the .war file with any packager (like 7zip). Then pack the resulted files/directories again with the highest possible compression.
Furthermore, install the MongoDB plugin. The final size is 96.5 MB for version 2.18.1.
